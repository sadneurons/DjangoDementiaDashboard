Python is an open source programming language with a huge, supportive
community of users spanning the globe. Originally created in the early 1990s by Guidao van Rossum
(a Monty Python fan - hence the name)  Python is used for many things on the dashboard. The data is pulled from its sources
on the internet by using HTTP requests issued by a python script. The data is then graphed automatically by a
different Python script. These scripts check to make sure they have th most updated version of the relevant data,
sometimes by reading the web pages of the organisation concerned, and checking whether their newest release matches
what is in the Dashboard database. The graphs are created with "Bokeh", a library of Python scripts
developed for creating graphs in HTML and Javascript which can be shown with ease on the web and have
some interactivity.
