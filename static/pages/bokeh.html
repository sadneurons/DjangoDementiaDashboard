<p> Bokeh (pronounced like 'Bouquet') is a technique in photography, but also
the name of a powerful suite of Python libraries that enable embedding
of visualisations in web pages. This is perfect for the dashboard, where
we want to give people the possibility of downloading the graphs in
high resolution '.png. format which is good for presentations etc.

Bokeh also allows you to zoom in on particular areas of a graph using the
toolbar (usually in the upper right of the graph). If you overdo it, you can reset the graph
using the reset tool at the bottom of the toolbar. Hovering over the tools
will tell you what they do.
