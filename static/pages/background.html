<p> The Greater Manchester Dementia Research centre
    exists as a self-funding entity within
    <a href="https://www.gmmh.nhs.uk"> Greater Manchester
    Mental Health Foundation Trust (GMMH)</a>. Formally set up in
    2018, the centre is concerned with running clinical trials
    on the <a href="https://www.nihr.ac.uk/">NIHR</a> portfolio.
The research centre also aims to improve the lives of
people living with dementia in GM by democratising access
to data. The dashboard is an attempt to collate
all of the information on dementia care and related topics in GM.

The dashboard is one project within the GMDRC.
